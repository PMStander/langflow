# Self-Healing System

This document describes the self-healing mechanisms used in the project management system. These mechanisms automatically detect and recover from common failure modes.

## Memory Inconsistency

### Detection
Memory inconsistencies are detected by comparing checksums stored in the memory-index.md file with the actual files in the .project directory.

### Resolution
1. Identify inconsistent files
2. Check for backup versions in the project history
3. Reconcile differences by merging changes
4. Update checksums in memory-index.md
5. Log the reconciliation in the task log

## Task Interruption

### Detection
Task interruptions are detected by checking for incomplete entries in the task-logs directory. An incomplete entry is one that doesn't have a completion time or has missing sections.

### Resolution
1. Identify the incomplete task log
2. Load the context from the task log
3. Resume the task from where it was interrupted
4. Complete the task log with the remaining information
5. Update the activeContext.md file with the current state

## Tool Failures

### Detection
Tool failures are detected by monitoring error patterns in the errors directory. Common patterns include:
- Build failures
- Runtime exceptions
- API errors
- Dependency issues

### Resolution
1. Identify the failing tool
2. Check for known solutions in the errors directory
3. Apply the appropriate fallback strategy:
   - Retry with different parameters
   - Use an alternative tool
   - Implement a workaround
4. Document the failure and resolution in the errors directory
5. Update error patterns to improve future detection

## Recovery Process

The general recovery process follows these steps:

1. Detect the failure mode
2. Log the failure details
3. Identify the appropriate recovery strategy
4. Apply the recovery strategy
5. Verify the recovery was successful
6. Document the recovery process
7. Update the system to prevent similar failures in the future

Each recovery action is logged and used to improve future resilience.
