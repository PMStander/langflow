# Implementation Progress and Roadmap: Langflow

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Features

#### Visual Flow Editor
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: The visual flow editor is fully functional, allowing users to create, edit, and visualize LangChain flows through a drag-and-drop interface. The editor uses ReactFlow for the graph visualization and interaction.
- **Limitations**: Performance may degrade with very large flows (100+ nodes).

#### Component Library
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: The component library includes a wide range of LangChain components, organized by category. Users can search and filter components, and view documentation for each component.
- **Limitations**: Some newer LangChain components may not be fully integrated yet.

#### Flow Execution
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: Users can execute flows directly from the UI, provide inputs, and view outputs. The system supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution.
- **Limitations**: Limited visibility into execution progress for long-running flows.

#### Flow Management
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: Users can save, load, duplicate, and organize flows. The system supports searching and filtering flows.
- **Limitations**: Limited organizational features (no hierarchical folders).

#### User Authentication
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: The system supports user registration, login, and basic profile management. Authentication is implemented using JWT.
- **Limitations**: Limited support for advanced authentication methods (OAuth, SSO).

#### API Deployment
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: Flows can be deployed as API endpoints, with automatic documentation generation.
- **Limitations**: Limited monitoring and analytics for API usage.

### Advanced Features

#### Custom Components
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: Users can create and register custom components that integrate with the visual editor.
- **Limitations**: Limited documentation and examples for custom component development.

#### Flow Templates
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: The system includes pre-built templates for common use cases, and users can create their own templates.
- **Limitations**: Limited template discovery and sharing features.

#### Code Export
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: Users can export flows as Python code for integration into external applications.
- **Limitations**: Generated code may require manual optimization for production use.

#### Collaboration
- **Status**: 🟡 Partially Implemented
- **Details**: Basic flow sharing functionality is available, but lacks advanced collaboration features.
- **Limitations**: No real-time collaboration or fine-grained permissions.

#### Version Control
- **Status**: 🟡 Partially Implemented
- **Details**: The system maintains basic version history for flows, but lacks advanced diff and merge capabilities.
- **Limitations**: Limited history retention and comparison features.

#### Flow Monitoring
- **Status**: 🟡 Partially Implemented
- **Details**: Basic execution metrics are available, but comprehensive monitoring is limited.
- **Limitations**: No long-term analytics or alerting capabilities.

### Infrastructure

#### Database Integration
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: The system supports both SQLite (for development) and PostgreSQL (for production) databases.
- **Limitations**: Limited support for other database systems.

#### Containerization
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: Docker and Docker Compose configurations are available for deployment.
- **Limitations**: Limited documentation for advanced deployment scenarios.

#### CI/CD
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
- **Details**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing and building are in place.
- **Limitations**: Limited automated deployment options.
