# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on developing an AI Flow Builder Assistant feature for Langflow that will help users build flows through natural language instructions. This feature will enable users to describe their desired flow in plain English, and the assistant will automatically construct the appropriate LangChain flow by selecting and connecting the right components.

## Immediate Goals
1. Finalize the implementation plan for the AI Flow Builder Assistant
2. Begin development of the Component Knowledge Base as the foundation
3. Design the API structure for the AI Assistant Service
4. Create a prototype of the frontend AI Assistant Panel
5. Implement the initial instruction parsing system

## Recent Decisions
1. **AI Assistant Architecture**: Designed a modular architecture with six main components: AI Assistant Panel, AI Assistant Service, Component Knowledge Base, Flow Construction Engine, Clarification Dialogue Manager, and LLM Provider Integration
2. **Phased Development Approach**: Adopted a four-phase development plan starting with foundation components and gradually adding advanced features
3. **Component Knowledge Base Priority**: Identified the Component Knowledge Base as the critical foundation for the entire feature
4. **LLM Provider Flexibility**: Designed for dynamic switching between different LLM backends and models at runtime

## Current State
- **Implementation Plan**: Completed comprehensive plan for the AI Flow Builder Assistant feature
- **Component Analysis**: Analyzed the existing component system and registry to understand how components are defined and connected
- **Flow Structure**: Examined the flow data structure and how flows are created and managed
- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Investigated how the frontend communicates with the backend for flow operations
- **Previous Issue**: Resolved frontend build process issues by running frontend and backend as separate services

## Next Steps
1. **Short-term**:
   - Begin implementation of the Component Knowledge Base
   - Design and implement the backend API endpoints for the AI Assistant Service
   - Create the frontend skeleton for the AI Assistant Panel
   - Develop the initial LLM provider interface

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Implement the instruction parsing system
   - Develop the flow construction engine
   - Integrate the frontend and backend components
   - Add the clarification system for ambiguous instructions

3. **Long-term**:
   - Implement advanced features like LLM provider flexibility
   - Enhance the user experience with improved visualization
   - Conduct comprehensive testing and optimization
   - Prepare documentation for users and developers
