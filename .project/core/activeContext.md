   - Add cache invalidation strategies
   - Monitor cache hit/miss rates
4. Add additional performance optimizations:
   - Add more indexes for frequently filtered fields
   - Implement query result pagination
   - Add database connection pooling configuration
   - Monitor query performance in production
5. Final polish and bug fixes:
   - Address any remaining bugs or issues
   - Perform final code review
   - Clean up technical debt
   - Prepare for production deployment
