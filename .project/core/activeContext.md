# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Planning the implementation of a Workspace Dashboard & CRM feature for Langflow
- Designing database schema for CRM entities (clients, invoices, opportunities, tasks)
- Creating UI mockups for the dashboard and CRM interfaces
- Developing implementation plans for backend and frontend components
- Establishing an implementation timeline with task dependencies

## Current State
- Workspace feature implementation completed:
  - Created Workspace and WorkspaceMember models
  - Implemented workspace management API endpoints
  - Built frontend components for workspace management
  - Added role-based permissions system
- Workspace Dashboard & CRM planning completed:
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan
  - Designed database schema for CRM entities
  - Created UI mockups for dashboard and CRM interfaces
  - Developed detailed backend implementation plan
  - Created frontend component structure plan
  - Established implementation timeline with task dependencies
- Planning documents created:
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-crm-plan.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-ui-mockups.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-backend-implementation.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-frontend-implementation.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-implementation-timeline.md`

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Phase 1 (Foundation):
   - Create CRM entity database models
   - Implement basic API endpoints
   - Add dashboard sidebar icon and navigation
   - Set up TypeScript interfaces and API hooks
2. Proceed to Phase 2 (Dashboard Implementation):
   - Implement dashboard analytics endpoints
   - Create dashboard layout and basic components
   - Build data visualization charts
3. Continue with Phase 3 (CRM Core Features):
   - Implement advanced filtering and search
   - Create client management interface
   - Build invoice tracking system
   - Develop task management interface
4. Complete Phase 4 (Advanced Features) and Phase 5 (Integration and Polish)

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Workspace feature implementation
- [x] Workspace Dashboard & CRM planning
- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Phase 2: Dashboard Implementation
- [ ] Phase 3: CRM Core Features
- [ ] Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Phase 5: Integration and Polish

## Technical Decisions
- Using D3.js for data visualization components
- Extending the existing workspace permission system for CRM entities
- Implementing a context-aware sidebar that changes based on the current view
- Using a modular approach to separate CRM entities into distinct models
- Leveraging existing UI component library for consistency

## Session Summary (2025-05-23)
