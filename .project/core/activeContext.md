# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing the AI Flow Builder Assistant feature for Langflow. We have completed Phase 1 (Foundation) by developing the Component Knowledge Base module and setting up the basic service architecture. We have also completed Phase 2 (Core Functionality) by implementing the instruction parsing system with LLM integration. We are now in Phase 3 (Advanced Features), having implemented the flow construction engine and frontend UI components. The next steps are to enhance the clarification system, implement testing, and prepare for Phase 4 (Testing and Refinement).

## Session Summary (2023-05-25)
Today we investigated the networking issues between the frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 7860) components. We confirmed that both services are running correctly and are accessible individually. We also verified that the proxy configuration in the frontend is correctly set up to forward API requests to the backend.

Our investigation revealed that:
1. The backend server is running on port 7860 and is accessible directly via curl
2. The frontend server is running on port 3000 and is accessible
3. Basic API endpoints like /health and /api/v1/auto_login are accessible through the frontend proxy
4. IPv6 connections to ::1:7860 are being refused, but IPv4 connections to 127.0.0.1:7860 work
5. The proxy configuration in vite.config.mts is correctly set up

The issue appears to be partially resolved, as basic functionality is working, but there may still be specific endpoints or contexts where the frontend has trouble connecting to the backend. We've updated the error documentation with our findings and potential solutions.

The next steps are to implement the suggested solutions, such as updating the LANGFLOW_HOST in .env to explicitly use 127.0.0.1, ensuring BACKEND_URL matches the actual backend URL, and potentially increasing timeout settings for API requests.

## Session Summary (2023-05-21)
Today we initialized a new session and reviewed the current state of the AI Flow Builder Assistant implementation. We confirmed that the core functionality of the AI Assistant feature is complete, with both the backend flow construction engine and frontend UI components implemented. The feature now enables users to create flows using natural language instructions, with support for clarification questions and dynamic LLM backend switching.

We identified that there may be some import errors in the frontend UI components that need to be resolved. Additionally, we noted potential networking issues between the frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 7860) components, with ETIMEDOUT errors when trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:7860. This networking issue will need to be investigated as it could impact the functionality of the application.

The next steps are to investigate and resolve the networking issues between frontend and backend, enhance the clarification system with more context and examples, implement end-to-end testing, and address any frontend UI component issues.

## Session Summary (2023-05-23)
Today we made significant progress on Phase 3 of the AI Flow Builder Assistant by implementing both the backend flow construction engine and the frontend UI components. This completes the core functionality of the AI Assistant feature, enabling users to create flows using natural language instructions.

In the morning, we implemented the flow construction engine with the following key components:
1. **FlowConstructor Class**: Created a new class responsible for building flows based on parsed instructions
2. **Component Selection Algorithm**: Implemented logic to select appropriate components based on requirements
3. **Connection Creation Logic**: Developed functionality to create connections between compatible components
4. **Parameter Configuration**: Added capability to set component parameters based on extracted values
5. **Node Positioning**: Implemented a layout algorithm for visually appealing flow presentation

In the afternoon, we implemented the frontend UI components for the AI Assistant Panel:
1. **API Queries**: Created TypeScript queries for interacting with the AI Assistant backend
2. **State Management**: Implemented a Zustand store for managing AI Assistant state
3. **UI Components**: Created components for instruction input, chat interface, flow preview, and LLM provider selection
4. **Integration**: Added the AI Assistant Panel to the main layout and ensured proper styling

We also fixed a critical issue with the AIAssistantServiceFactory class that was causing the backend build to fail. The issue was related to the missing service_class parameter in the constructor. We updated the factory class to properly initialize the parent ServiceFactory class and implement the create method instead of __call__.

Additionally, we fixed an import issue in the frontend code where we were trying to import useFlowsManagerStore as a named export instead of a default export.

The implementation follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns, includes comprehensive error handling, and provides an intuitive user interface that follows Langflow's design patterns.

With these implementations, the AI Flow Builder Assistant can now interpret natural language instructions, build actual flows, handle clarification questions, and provide a preview of the generated flow, all within an intuitive user interface.

## Session Summary (2023-05-22)
We have successfully implemented the instruction parsing system for the AI Flow Builder Assistant. This system can interpret natural language instructions, identify required components and connections, extract parameter values, and generate clarification questions when needed. We've also added support for multiple LLM providers with dynamic switching capabilities. The implementation includes comprehensive tests and API endpoints for all functionality.

1. Created the InstructionParser class with LLM integration
2. Enhanced the AI Assistant Service with instruction parsing capabilities
3. Updated API endpoints to support instruction interpretation and LLM provider management
4. Added robust validation for component and connection compatibility
