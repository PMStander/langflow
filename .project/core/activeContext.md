# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on resolving frontend and backend integration issues in the Langflow application. Specifically, addressing memory constraints during the frontend build process and ensuring proper communication between frontend and backend components.

## Immediate Goals
1. Establish a working development environment despite memory limitations
2. Implement a reliable workaround for the frontend build process
3. Document the solution for future reference
4. Investigate long-term solutions for memory optimization

## Recent Decisions
1. **Separated Frontend and Backend**: Running the frontend and backend as separate services to avoid the memory-intensive build process
2. **Environment Configuration**: Modified the `.env` file to comment out `LANGFLOW_FRONTEND_PATH` to prevent the backend from looking for non-existent frontend files
3. **Development Mode**: Using the frontend in development mode (`npm start`) instead of building for production

## Current State
- **Backend**: Running successfully on port 7860
- **Frontend**: Running in development mode on port 3000
- **Build Process**: Failing due to memory constraints (3.8GB RAM with 1GB swap)
- **Error**: `FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory`
- **Frontend Build Directory**: Incomplete, containing only a favicon.ico file

## Next Steps
1. **Short-term**:
   - Document the current workaround in project documentation
   - Create an issue in the repository to track memory-related build failures
   - Test with increased NODE_OPTIONS memory limit if possible

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Review and optimize dependencies to reduce memory footprint
   - Implement a more robust build process that can handle memory constraints
   - Add build flags for low-memory environments

3. **Long-term**:
   - Consider splitting the frontend into smaller, more manageable packages
   - Evaluate alternative build tools that are more memory-efficient
   - Provide options for building in the cloud and downloading artifacts
