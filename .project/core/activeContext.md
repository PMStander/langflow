- Implementing Phase 1 (Foundation) of the Workspace Dashboard & CRM feature
- Creating CRM entity database models (Client, Invoice, Opportunity, Task)
- Implementing basic API endpoints for CRM entities
- Adding dashboard sidebar icon and navigation
- Setting up TypeScript interfaces and API hooks

## Current State
- Workspace feature implementation completed:
  - Created Workspace and WorkspaceMember models
  - Implemented workspace management API endpoints
  - Built frontend components for workspace management
  - Added role-based permissions system
- Workspace Dashboard & CRM planning completed:
  - Created comprehensive implementation plan
  - Designed database schema for CRM entities
  - Created UI mockups for dashboard and CRM interfaces
  - Developed detailed backend implementation plan
  - Created frontend component structure plan
  - Established implementation timeline with task dependencies
- Planning documents created:
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-crm-plan.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-ui-mockups.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-backend-implementation.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-frontend-implementation.md`
  - `.project/plans/workspace-dashboard-implementation-timeline.md`

## Next Steps
1. Implement CRM entity database models:
   - Create Client model
   - Create Invoice model
   - Create Opportunity model
   - Create Task model
   - Update existing models with new relationships
   - Create database migration script
2. Implement basic API endpoints:
   - Create CRUD endpoints for Client entity
   - Create CRUD endpoints for Invoice entity
   - Create CRUD endpoints for Opportunity entity
   - Create CRUD endpoints for Task entity
   - Add permission checks for shared resources
3. Implement dashboard sidebar navigation:
   - Add dashboard icon to sidebar
   - Update routing configuration
   - Implement context-aware sidebar navigation
4. Set up TypeScript interfaces and API hooks:
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for CRM entities
   - Set up RTK Query API hooks for backend communication
   - Configure store integration

- Extending the existing workspace permission system for CRM entities
- Implementing a context-aware sidebar that changes based on the current view
- Using a modular approach to separate CRM entities into distinct models
- Leveraging existing UI component library for consistency
