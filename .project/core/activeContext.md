# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing a Workspace feature for Langflow as a new top-level hierarchy above Projects and Flows
- Created database models, API endpoints, and migration scripts for the Workspace feature
- Completed frontend implementation with UI components, state management, and integration
- Fixed frontend proxy configuration issues
- Successfully completed rebase process to integrate workspace management features

## Current State
- Database schema modifications completed:
  - Created Workspace and WorkspaceMember models
  - Updated User model with workspace relationships
  - Updated Folder model with workspace relationship
- API endpoints implemented:
  - Created workspace management endpoints
  - Created workspace member management endpoints
  - Updated router configuration
- Database migration script created:
  - Creates necessary tables
  - Adds workspace_id to folder table
  - Creates personal workspaces for existing users
  - Migrates existing folders to personal workspaces
- Fixed frontend proxy configuration issues:
  - Updated frontend .env file to use consistent hostname (127.0.0.1 instead of localhost)
  - Verified proxy functionality with successful API calls
- Frontend implementation completed:
  - Created workspace management UI components
  - Updated project sidebar to filter by workspace
  - Implemented workspace selector in header
  - Added role-based permission UI
- Session initialized (2024-06-03):
  - Loaded memory bank
  - Reviewed implementation plan and current state
  - Ready for testing and documentation phase

## Next Steps
1. Create tests for the workspace functionality:
   - Unit tests for workspace models and API endpoints
   - Integration tests for workspace-project-flow relationships
   - Frontend tests for workspace UI components
2. Create documentation for the workspace feature:
   - User guide for workspace management
   - API documentation for workspace endpoints
   - Migration guide for existing users
3. Perform final review and optimization:
   - Check for edge cases and potential issues
   - Optimize performance for large workspaces
   - Ensure proper error handling
4. Fix additional UI issues:
   - Review other modals for similar layout issues
   - Ensure consistent styling across all workspace-related components

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Database schema modifications
- [x] API endpoint implementation
- [x] Database migration script
- [x] Frontend models and types
- [x] Frontend state management
- [x] Frontend UI components
- [x] Project sidebar integration
- [x] Flow endpoint updates
- [x] Permission middleware
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Documentation

## Technical Decisions
- Used a many-to-many relationship between workspaces and users through the WorkspaceMember model
- Implemented role-based permissions (owner, editor, viewer)
- Created a personal workspace for each existing user to maintain backward compatibility
- Updated the folder unique constraint to include workspace_id for proper isolation

## Session Summary (2024-06-03)
- Initialized memory bank for new session
- Reviewed current state of workspace feature implementation
- Fixed UI layout issue in the "Create Workspace" popup
- Implemented proper workspace-project filtering functionality
- Prepared for testing and documentation phase

## Previous Session Summary (2024-06-02)
- Successfully implemented the frontend components for the Workspace feature
- Created workspace management UI, workspace selector, and member management
- Updated project sidebar to filter by workspace
- Integrated workspace context throughout the application
- Implemented flow endpoint updates to respect workspace permissions
- Created middleware to verify workspace access
- Ready for the final phase of implementation (testing and documentation)

## Session Summary (2024-06-01)
- Successfully implemented the database schema and API endpoints for the Workspace feature
- Created a comprehensive migration script to handle existing data
- Prepared for the next phase of implementation (frontend and integration)
- All changes have been committed and are ready for the next session
