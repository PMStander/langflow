## Core User Stories

### Flow Creation and Management

- User can choose between different export formats (script, module, etc.)

### Component Management

#### US-5: Component Discovery
**As a** user  
**I want to** browse and search available components  
**So that** I can find the right tools for my application

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Components are organized by category (LLMs, chains, tools, etc.)

- Component descriptions explain their purpose and usage
- Examples or templates demonstrate common use cases
- New or featured components are highlighted

#### US-6: Component Configuration
**As a** user  
**I want to** configure component parameters through a user-friendly interface  
**So that** I can customize behavior without understanding the underlying code

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parameters have clear labels and descriptions
- Required parameters are clearly marked
- Parameters have appropriate input types (text, number, dropdown, etc.)
- Complex parameters have specialized editors (JSON, code, etc.)
- Default values are provided where appropriate
- Validation prevents invalid configurations

#### US-7: Custom Component Creation
**As a** developer  
**I want to** create and register custom components  
**So that** I can extend Langflow with my own functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can define custom components through code
- Custom components appear in the component library
- Custom components can be configured like built-in components
- Documentation explains the custom component creation process
- Examples demonstrate common custom component patterns

### User Management

#### US-8: User Authentication
**As a** user  
**I want to** securely log in to the system  
**So that** my flows and settings are protected

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can register with email and password
- User can log in with credentials
- User can reset forgotten password
- Sessions expire after a period of inactivity
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited

#### US-9: User Profile Management
**As a** user  
**I want to** manage my profile and settings  
**So that** I can customize my experience

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can update profile information
- User can change password
- User can set preferences (theme, language, etc.)
- User can manage API keys for external services
- User can view usage statistics

### Deployment and Integration

#### US-10: API Deployment
**As a** developer  
**I want to** expose my flow as an API  
**So that** other applications can use it

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can deploy a flow as an API endpoint
- System generates API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- API supports authentication and rate limiting
- User can test the API from the interface
- User can monitor API usage and performance

#### US-11: Environment Management
**As a** user  
**I want to** manage environment variables and secrets  
**So that** I can securely configure my flows

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can define environment variables
- Sensitive values are stored securely
- Variables can be used in component configurations
- Different environments can have different values
- System doesn't expose secrets in logs or exports

## Advanced User Stories

### Collaboration

#### US-12: Flow Sharing
**As a** team member  
**I want to** share flows with colleagues  
**So that** we can collaborate on LLM applications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can share flows with specific users or teams
- User can set permission levels (view, edit, execute)
- Recipients receive notifications of shared flows
- Changes to shared flows are tracked
- Multiple users can work on a flow (not necessarily simultaneously)

#### US-13: Version Control
**As a** developer  
**I want to** track changes to my flows over time  
**So that** I can revert to previous versions if needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can view the change history
- User can compare different versions
- User can restore previous versions
- Changes include metadata (timestamp, user, description)

### Advanced Features

#### US-14: Flow Templates
