# Task Log: Session Start and Memory Bank Initialization

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-06-02
- **Time Started**: 10:00
- **Time Completed**: 10:15
- **Files Modified**:
  - .project/task-logs/task-log_2024-06-02_session-start.md (new)
  - .project/core/activeContext.md (updated)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Initialize the session, load memory bank, and prepare for the next phase of the Workspace feature implementation.

- **Implementation**:
  1. Checked the existence of the `.project/` directory structure
  2. Verified all required memory files are present
  3. Loaded memory layers from `.project/core/`
  4. Reviewed the current state of the project from activeContext.md
  5. Analyzed the workspace implementation plan and recent task logs

- **Challenges**:
  1. No rules.md file found at the root level, but rules are available in other locations
  2. Need to ensure proper understanding of the current implementation state before proceeding

- **Decisions**:
  1. Proceed with the existing memory bank structure as it is comprehensive
  2. Focus on the next steps outlined in the activeContext.md file
  3. Prepare for frontend implementation of the Workspace feature

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 21/23
- **Strengths**:
  - Successfully loaded all memory layers
  - Gained comprehensive understanding of the project state
  - Identified clear next steps for implementation
  - Maintained continuity with previous sessions

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Could create a consolidated rules.md file at the root level for easier access
  - More detailed analysis of the frontend requirements could be beneficial

## Next Steps
- Begin frontend implementation for the Workspace feature:
  1. Create workspace management UI components
  2. Update project sidebar and navigation
  3. Implement workspace selector
- Update project endpoints to work with workspaces
- Update flow endpoints to respect workspace permissions
- Implement middleware to verify workspace access
- Create tests for the new functionality
