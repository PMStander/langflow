## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement Phase 4 (Advanced Features) of the CRM module, focusing on reporting and analytics features, data export functionality, and advanced data visualization components.
- **Implementation**: 
  1. **Backend Implementation**:
     - Created a new reports.py file with endpoints for generating various report types
     - Implemented report generation logic for sales overview, client activity, opportunity pipeline, etc.
     - Added data export functionality for CSV, JSON, and Excel formats
     - Integrated the reports router with the main API router

  2. **Frontend Implementation**:
     - Created a new ReportsPage.tsx component with tabs for standard and custom reports
     - Implemented report configuration UI with report type, time frame, and client filters
     - Added DateRangePicker component for custom date range selection
     - Created ReportChart component with multiple visualization options (bar, pie, line charts)
     - Implemented ReportDataTable component for displaying report metrics
     - Added export functionality for report data

  3. **Data Export Functionality**:
     - Created exportUtils.ts with functions for exporting data to CSV and JSON formats
     - Implemented data formatting for different entity types
     - Added export buttons to entity list pages (starting with ClientsPage)

  4. **Navigation and Routing**:
     - Updated CRM sidebar to include a Reports link
     - Added the Reports page to the CRM routes
     - Updated the CRM store to include the 'reports' view type

- **Challenges**: 
  - Designing a flexible report generation system that can handle different report types
  - Implementing proper data formatting for export functionality
  - Creating reusable chart components that work with different data structures
  - Ensuring proper integration between backend and frontend for report generation
  
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used a modular approach for report generation with separate functions for each report type
  - Implemented a flexible export system that can handle different formats and entity types
  - Created reusable chart components that can adapt to different data structures
  - Used tabs for organizing different report types (standard, custom, saved)
  - Added placeholder implementations for features to be completed in future phases

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive reporting system with multiple report types
  - Flexible data export functionality for different formats
  - Reusable chart components with multiple visualization options
  - Clean integration with existing CRM features
  - Proper error handling and loading states
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Custom report builder functionality is currently a placeholder
  - Some report types have placeholder implementations that need to be completed

## Next Steps
- Complete the implementation of all report types (client activity, invoice aging, etc.)
- Implement the custom report builder functionality
- Add saved reports functionality with database persistence
- Implement scheduled reports with email delivery
- Add more advanced data visualization options
- Integrate export functionality with the remaining entity pages (invoices, opportunities, tasks)
- Add comprehensive testing for all reporting and export features
