# Task Log: Frontend Proxy Connection Fix

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2025-05-23
- **Time Started**: 07:40
- **Time Completed**: 07:50
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/Users/peetstander/Projects/langflow/src/frontend/.env`
  - `/Users/peetstander/Projects/langflow/src/frontend/vite.config.mts`

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Fix frontend proxy timeout errors when connecting to backend API
- **Problem**: Frontend Vite dev server was experiencing `ETIMEDOUT` errors when trying to proxy API requests to backend at `127.0.0.1:7860`
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Created frontend-specific `.env` file with proper proxy configuration
  2. Enhanced Vite proxy configuration with timeout settings and error handling
  3. Changed proxy target from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` for better compatibility
  4. Added comprehensive proxy logging and error handling
- **Challenges**: 
  - Initial connection timeouts despite backend being accessible directly
  - Need to identify that the issue was proxy configuration rather than backend availability
- **Decisions**: 
  - Created separate frontend `.env` file to ensure Vite loads proper environment variables
  - Enhanced proxy configuration with extended timeouts (2 minutes) and error logging
  - Used `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` for better IPv4/IPv6 compatibility

## Implementation Details

### Created Frontend Environment File
Created `/Users/peetstander/Projects/langflow/src/frontend/.env`:
```properties
# Frontend-specific environment variables
# This file ensures the Vite dev server can properly proxy to the backend

# Proxy target for API requests  
VITE_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:7860

# Frontend port
VITE_PORT=3000

# Backend URL for the frontend application
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:7860

# Enable development mode
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Enhanced Vite Proxy Configuration
Updated `/Users/peetstander/Projects/langflow/src/frontend/vite.config.mts` with:
- Extended timeout settings (120 seconds)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Better proxy event monitoring

## Verification
- ✅ Backend health check: `curl http://localhost:7860/health_check` returns `{"status":"ok","chat":"ok","db":"ok"}`
- ✅ Frontend proxy health check: `curl http://localhost:3000/health_check` returns same response
- ✅ Frontend proxy API version: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/version` returns `{"version":"1.4.2","main_version":"1.4.2","package":"Langflow"}`
- ✅ Frontend application accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Quickly identified the root cause (proxy configuration vs backend availability)
  - Created comprehensive solution with proper error handling
  - Verified solution works across multiple endpoints
  - Documented solution for future reference
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Could have checked frontend-specific environment variables earlier

## Next Steps
- Frontend development environment is now fully functional
- Both `make backend` and `make frontend` should work without proxy errors
- Ready to proceed with regular development workflow

## Resolution Summary
The frontend proxy timeout errors were resolved by:
1. Creating a frontend-specific `.env` file with proper VITE environment variables
2. Enhancing the Vite proxy configuration with extended timeouts and error handling
3. Using `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` for better network compatibility

The frontend can now successfully proxy all API requests to the backend without timeout errors.
