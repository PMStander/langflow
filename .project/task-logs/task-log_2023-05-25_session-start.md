# Task Log: SessionStart Event Execution

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2023-05-25
- **Time Started**: 08:00
- **Time Completed**: 08:15
- **Files Modified**: None

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Initialize the memory system by executing the SessionStart event handler, verifying the memory bank structure, and loading all memory layers.

- **Implementation**:
  1. Checked if the `.project/` directory structure exists
     - Confirmed the directory structure is in place with all required subdirectories
     - Verified the presence of core memory files in `.project/core/`
  
  2. Loaded all memory layers
     - Working Memory: Loaded `.project/core/activeContext.md`
     - Short-Term Memory: Reviewed recent task logs in `.project/task-logs/`
     - Long-Term Memory: Loaded core files from `.project/core/`
  
  3. Verified memory consistency
     - Checked memory-index.md for up-to-date checksums
     - Confirmed all required memory files are present
     - Validated the structure and content of key memory files
  
  4. Identified current task context
     - Current focus is on resolving networking issues between frontend and backend
     - Frontend (port 3000) cannot connect to backend (port 7860)
     - ETIMEDOUT and ECONNREFUSED errors when attempting connections
     - A networking issue resolution plan has been created

- **Challenges**:
  1. None - the memory bank structure was already properly set up
  2. All required files were present and up-to-date

- **Decisions**:
  1. Prioritized loading the activeContext.md file to understand current work focus
  2. Reviewed the networking error file to understand the current issue
  3. Examined the networking issue resolution plan to understand the planned approach
  4. Identified the networking issue as the current priority for investigation

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**:
  - Comprehensive verification of memory system structure
  - Thorough loading of all memory layers
  - Clear identification of current task context
  - Efficient execution of the SessionStart event handler
  - Proper documentation of the initialization process
  - Recognition of the networking issue as the current priority

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - None identified for this task

## Next Steps
1. Begin investigation of the networking issue between frontend and backend
2. Follow the networking issue resolution plan to identify the root cause
3. Implement a solution to restore communication between frontend and backend
4. Document the resolution process and any configuration changes
5. Update the activeContext.md file with the results of the investigation
