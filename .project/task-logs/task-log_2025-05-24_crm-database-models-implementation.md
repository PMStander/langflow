## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement the CRM database models for Client, Invoice, Opportunity, and Task entities
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created SQLModel classes for each CRM entity with proper relationships
  - Updated User and Workspace models to include CRM relationships
  - Created database migration script for the new tables
  - Added proper type hints and docstrings
- **Challenges**: 
  - Ensuring proper relationship definitions between models
  - Setting up correct foreign key constraints in the migration script
- **Decisions**: 
  - Used SQLModel for all models to maintain consistency with existing codebase
  - Implemented cascade delete for related entities
  - Added proper indexes for performance optimization

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**: 
  - Comprehensive implementation of all required models
  - Proper relationship definitions between models
  - Well-structured migration script with proper indexes
  - Consistent naming conventions with existing codebase
- **Areas for Improvement**: None identified for this implementation

## Next Steps
- Implement basic API endpoints for CRM entities
- Add permission checks for shared resources
- Write unit tests for the models and API endpoints
- Update the frontend with TypeScript interfaces for the CRM entities
