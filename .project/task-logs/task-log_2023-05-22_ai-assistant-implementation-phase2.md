## Task Details
- **Goal**: Implement Phase 2 (Core Functionality) of the AI Flow Builder Assistant plan, focusing on the instruction parsing system with LLM integration.

- **Implementation**:
  1. Created the InstructionParser class:
     - Implemented methods to parse natural language instructions using LLMs
     - Added support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
     - Developed validation logic to check component and connection compatibility
     - Created clarification question generation for ambiguous or incomplete instructions

  2. Enhanced the AIAssistantService:
     - Integrated the InstructionParser into the service
     - Added methods for setting LLM providers and models
     - Improved error handling for instruction parsing
     - Implemented clarification response processing

  3. Updated the API endpoints:
     - Enhanced the instruction interpretation endpoint
     - Added support for specifying LLM providers and models
     - Created endpoints for clarification response processing
     - Added endpoints for LLM provider management

  4. Created comprehensive tests:
     - Added tests for the InstructionParser
     - Updated tests for the AIAssistantService
     - Ensured good test coverage for all new functionality

- **Challenges**:
  1. Designing a flexible LLM integration that supports multiple providers
  2. Creating a robust validation system for parsed instructions
  3. Handling potential errors in LLM responses
  4. Ensuring proper error handling throughout the system

- **Decisions**:
  1. Used LangChain's chat models for LLM integration to leverage existing functionality
  2. Implemented a JSON-based response format for structured parsing
  3. Added validation logic to check component and connection compatibility
  4. Created a clarification system for handling ambiguous or incomplete instructions

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**:
  - Comprehensive implementation of the instruction parsing system
  - Support for multiple LLM providers
  - Robust validation and error handling
  - Clear API design for client integration
  - Thorough test coverage

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - The LLM prompt could be enhanced with more examples and context
  - Error handling for malformed LLM responses could be more robust
  - API key management could be improved to use the settings service more effectively

## Next Steps
1. Implement the flow construction engine based on parsed instructions
2. Create the frontend UI components for the AI Assistant
3. Integrate the frontend with the backend API endpoints
4. Enhance the clarification system with more context and examples
5. Implement the LLM provider switching UI
