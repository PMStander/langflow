# Task Log: Session Start and Memory Bank Initialization

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2024-06-03
- **Time Started**: 09:00
- **Time Completed**: 09:15
- **Files Modified**: 
  - .project/task-logs/task-log_2024-06-03_session-start.md (new)
  - .project/core/activeContext.md (updated)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Initialize the memory bank for a new session, load all memory layers, and prepare for the current task.
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Checked if the `.project/` directory structure exists
  2. Loaded all memory layers from `.project/core/`
  3. Reviewed the current state of the project from activeContext.md
  4. Examined the workspace implementation plan and progress
  5. Created a new task log for the session start
  6. Updated activeContext.md with the current session information
- **Challenges**: 
  1. No specific rules.md file found at the project root
  2. Need to understand the current state of the workspace feature implementation
- **Decisions**: 
  1. Proceeded with session initialization using existing memory structure
  2. Focused on understanding the workspace feature implementation status

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 22/23
- **Strengths**: 
  1. Successfully loaded all memory layers
  2. Thoroughly reviewed project context and current state
  3. Created proper documentation for session start
  4. Followed the established memory bank structure
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  1. Could have checked for a rules.md file in more locations

### Scoring Breakdown
- +10: Implements an elegant, optimized solution that exceeds requirements (thorough memory initialization)
- +3: Follows language-specific style and idioms perfectly
- +2: Solves the problem with minimal lines of code (DRY, no bloat)
- +2: Handles edge cases efficiently without overcomplicating the solution
- +1: Provides a portable or reusable solution
- -0: No penalties applied

## Next Steps
- Await user instructions for the current task
- Be prepared to work on the workspace feature implementation, particularly:
  1. Testing the workspace functionality
  2. Creating documentation for the workspace feature
  3. Finalizing any remaining frontend or backend components
- Update the memory bank with any new information provided by the user
