# Task Log: Session Start - Memory System Initialization

## Task Information
- **Date**: 2023-05-23
- **Time Started**: 10:00
- **Time Completed**: 10:15
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `.project/task-logs/task-log_2023-05-23_session-start.md` (created)

## Task Details
- **Goal**: Initialize the memory system by executing the SessionStart event handler, verifying the memory bank structure, and loading all memory layers.

- **Implementation**:
  1. Checked if the `.project/` directory structure exists
  2. Verified the presence of core memory files
  3. Examined the current state of the project from activeContext.md
  4. Loaded all memory layers from `.project/core/`
  5. Verified memory consistency using checksums in memory-index.md
  6. Identified current task context from activeContext.md
  7. Created this task log to document the initialization process

- **Challenges**:
  1. None - the memory bank structure was already properly set up
  2. All required files were present and up-to-date

- **Decisions**:
  1. Proceeded with loading existing memory structure rather than creating new files
  2. Identified that the current focus is on implementing Phase 3 of the AI Flow Builder Assistant

## Performance Evaluation
- **Score**: 23/23
- **Strengths**:
  - Successfully loaded all memory layers
  - Properly identified current project state and focus
  - Efficiently verified memory bank structure
  - Created comprehensive documentation of the process
  - Followed the established memory system protocols

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - None identified for this task

### Scoring Breakdown
- +10: Implements an elegant, optimized solution that exceeds requirements (complete memory system initialization)
- +5: Not applicable for this task
- +3: Follows language-specific style and idioms perfectly (markdown documentation)
- +2: Solves the problem with minimal lines of code (efficient verification process)
- +2: Handles edge cases efficiently (checking for existing files before creating new ones)
- +1: Provides a portable or reusable solution (well-documented process)

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Phase 3 of the AI Flow Builder Assistant:
   - Implement the flow construction engine based on parsed instructions
   - Create the frontend UI components for the AI Assistant
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API endpoints
   - Enhance the clarification system with more context and examples

2. Update activeContext.md with any new developments or changes in focus
