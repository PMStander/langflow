## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks

1. **Database Schema Complexity**
   - Risk: Complex relationships between CRM entities might lead to performance issues
   - Mitigation: Careful schema design with performance testing early in Phase 1

2. **Data Visualization Performance**
   - Risk: Large datasets might cause performance issues in charts and visualizations
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, filtering, and data aggregation at the API level

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Risk: Complex dashboard layouts might not translate well to mobile devices
   - Mitigation: Mobile-first design approach and regular testing on different screen sizes

4. **Integration with Existing Workspace Features**
   - Risk: New features might conflict with existing workspace functionality
   - Mitigation: Thorough integration testing and clear separation of concerns

5. **Permission Management Complexity**
   - Risk: Complex permission rules might lead to security issues or usability problems
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive security audit and user testing of permission scenarios

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
   - All planned features are implemented and working correctly
   - CRM entities can be created, read, updated, and deleted
   - Dashboard displays accurate and relevant data
   - Permission system correctly restricts access based on user roles

2. **Performance**
   - Dashboard loads within 2 seconds on standard connections
   - CRM entity lists handle at least 1000 records without performance degradation
   - Charts and visualizations render within 1 second

3. **Usability**
   - Users can navigate between dashboard and CRM features intuitively
   - Forms provide clear validation and feedback
   - Mobile experience is functional and user-friendly
   - Accessibility standards are met (WCAG 2.1 AA)

4. **Security**
   - All CRM data is properly isolated between workspaces
   - Permission checks are enforced at both API and UI levels
   - Sensitive operations are properly logged

## Next Steps

1. Finalize and approve the implementation plan
2. Set up project tracking in issue management system
3. Assign resources to Phase 1 tasks
4. Schedule regular progress reviews
5. Begin implementation of Phase 1
