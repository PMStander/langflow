# Networking Issue Resolution Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to investigate and resolve the connection issues between the Langflow frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 7860) components. The frontend is currently unable to connect to the backend, resulting in ETIMEDOUT errors.

## Objectives
1. Identify the root cause of the connection issues
2. Implement a solution to restore communication between frontend and backend
3. Document the resolution process and any configuration changes
4. Establish best practices to prevent similar issues in the future

## Investigation Phase (Completed)

### Step 1: Verify Service Status (✓)
- ✓ Backend service is running on port 7860 (confirmed with `lsof -i :7860`)
- ✓ Frontend service is running on port 3000 (confirmed with `lsof -i :3000`)
- ✓ Both ports are listening and accessible

### Step 2: Test Direct Connection (✓)
- ✓ Direct connection to backend API works (`curl http://localhost:7860/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`)
- ✓ Connection through frontend proxy works (`curl http://localhost:3000/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`)
- ✓ Basic API endpoints like `/api/v1/auto_login` are accessible through both direct and proxy connections

### Step 3: Examine Configuration (✓)
- ✓ `.env` file has `LANGFLOW_HOST=127.0.0.1` and `BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:7860/`
- ✓ Frontend configuration in `src/frontend/src/customization/config-constants.ts` has `PROXY_TARGET="http://localhost:7860"`
- ✓ Vite proxy configuration in `src/frontend/vite.config.mts` is correctly set up

### Step 4: Network Analysis (✓)
- ✓ IPv6 connections to `::1:7860` are being refused, but IPv4 connections to `127.0.0.1:7860` work
- ✓ No firewall issues detected (though full firewall status check requires sudo privileges)
- ✓ Proxy is correctly forwarding requests for basic endpoints

### Step 5: Environment Comparison (✓)
- ✓ Configuration appears to be standard for local development
- ✓ No significant differences identified that would cause the issue

## Resolution Phase (In Progress)

### Approach 1: Configuration Updates (Recommended)
- Update LANGFLOW_HOST in .env to explicitly use 127.0.0.1 (avoid IPv6 issues)
- Ensure BACKEND_URL in .env is set to the correct URL (http://127.0.0.1:7860/ instead of localhost)
- Restart both frontend and backend services after changes
- Status: ⏳ Pending implementation

### Approach 2: Network Settings (Partially Verified)
- ✓ No firewall issues detected for basic connections
- ✓ Direct connections to backend work correctly
- Consider disabling IPv6 for the application if IPv4 works reliably
- Status: ⏳ Partially implemented

### Approach 3: CORS Configuration (Verified Not Needed)
- ✓ CORS is correctly configured in the backend (CORSMiddleware with allow_origins=["*"])
- ✓ Basic API endpoints work correctly through the proxy
- Status: ✓ No changes needed

### Approach 4: Connection Timeout Settings (Recommended)
- Increase timeout settings for API requests in the frontend
- Update axios.defaults.timeout in the frontend code
- Consider adding retry logic for failed connections
- Status: ⏳ Pending implementation

## Testing and Validation (Partially Completed)
- ✓ Verified basic connection with curl to both direct backend and frontend proxy
- ✓ Confirmed health endpoint works correctly through both direct and proxy connections
- ⏳ Need to test all frontend features that depend on backend communication
- ⏳ Need to implement automated health checks for continuous monitoring

## Documentation (In Progress)
- ✓ Updated error documentation with investigation findings
- ✓ Updated networking issue resolution plan with current status
- ⏳ Need to record configuration changes once implemented
- ⏳ Need to create troubleshooting guide for similar issues

## Updated Timeline
- Investigation Phase: Completed (2023-05-25)
- Resolution Implementation: 1 day (Pending)
- Testing and Validation: 1 day (Partially Completed)
- Documentation: 0.5 day (In Progress)

## Success Criteria (Partially Met)
- ✓ Basic frontend-backend communication works for some endpoints
- ⏳ Need to eliminate remaining ETIMEDOUT errors in network logs
- ⏳ Need to ensure all API calls from frontend to backend complete successfully
- ⏳ Need to verify application functions normally with frontend-backend communication

## Responsible Team Members
- Backend Developer: Verify backend configuration and service (Completed)
- Frontend Developer: Test frontend connection and update configuration (In Progress)
- DevOps: Assist with network configuration and environment setup (Pending if needed)

## Next Steps
1. Implement the recommended configuration updates:
   - Update LANGFLOW_HOST in .env to explicitly use 127.0.0.1
   - Ensure BACKEND_URL in .env is set to http://127.0.0.1:7860/
   - Increase timeout settings for API requests
2. Restart both frontend and backend services
3. Test all frontend features that depend on backend communication
4. Document the changes and create a troubleshooting guide

## Contingency Plan
If the recommended approaches fail to resolve the issue:
- Consider containerizing both frontend and backend with Docker Compose
- Implement a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) to handle connections
- Explore alternative communication methods (e.g., message queue)
