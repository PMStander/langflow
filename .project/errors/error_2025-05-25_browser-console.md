## Error 1: Infinite Update Loop in HomePage Component

### Error Message
```
Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.
at HomePage (http://localhost:3000/src/pages/MainPage/pages/homePage/index.tsx:39:21)
```

### Root Cause
The HomePage component has an infinite update loop in the useEffect hook at line 85. The component is trying to toggle between "flows" and "components" views when no items are found, but it's missing proper dependency tracking and loop prevention.

### Solution
Updated the useEffect hook in `src/frontend/src/pages/MainPage/pages/homePage/index.tsx` to:
1. Add all required dependencies to the useEffect dependency array
2. Add a condition to prevent the infinite toggling between flow types
3. Only change the flow type if there are items of the other type available

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (
    !isEmptyFolder &&
    flows?.find(
      (flow) =>
        flow.folder_id === (folderId ?? myCollectionId) &&
        flow.is_component === (flowType === "components"),
    ) === undefined
  ) {
    // Prevent infinite loop by only toggling if we haven't already checked both types
    const newFlowType = flowType === "flows" ? "components" : "flows";
    if (
      flows?.find(
        (flow) =>
          flow.folder_id === (folderId ?? myCollectionId) &&
          flow.is_component === (newFlowType === "components"),
      ) !== undefined
    ) {
      setFlowType(newFlowType);
    }
  }
}, [isEmptyFolder, flowType, flows, folderId, myCollectionId]);
```

## Error 2: Supabase Connection Configuration Issue

### Error Message
Multiple 500 errors on API endpoints before login, which were resolved after successful login.

### Root Cause
The Supabase pooler URL for the database connection requires SSL connection, but the current database connection settings don't include SSL parameters.

### Solution
1. Updated the `_get_connect_args` method in `src/backend/base/langflow/services/database/service.py` to add SSL parameters for Supabase connections:

```python
def _get_connect_args(self):
    settings = self.settings_service.settings

    if settings.db_driver_connection_settings is not None:
        return settings.db_driver_connection_settings

    if settings.database_url and settings.database_url.startswith("sqlite"):
        return {
            "check_same_thread": False,
            "timeout": settings.db_connect_timeout,
        }
    
    # Add SSL parameters for Supabase connections
    if settings.database_url and "supabase" in settings.database_url:
        return {
            "sslmode": "require",
        }

    return {}
```

2. Enabled database connection retry in the `.env` file:

```
LANGFLOW_DATABASE_CONNECTION_RETRY=true
```

## Error 3: Duplicate API Request

### Error Message
```
Duplicate request: /api/v1/variables/
```

### Root Cause
The application is making duplicate requests to the variables API endpoint, which could be due to:
1. Multiple components requesting the same data
2. Race conditions in the API request logic

### Solution
This is a minor issue that doesn't require immediate fixing as it doesn't cause application failure. However, for future optimization, we should:

1. Implement request deduplication in the API client
2. Use a state management solution like React Query that handles duplicate requests automatically
3. Review components that might be triggering duplicate requests

## Conclusion

The most critical issues have been fixed:
1. The infinite update loop in the HomePage component
2. The Supabase connection configuration issue

These fixes should resolve the main errors in the console and improve the application's stability. The application should now be able to connect to the Supabase database properly and avoid the infinite update loop in the HomePage component.
