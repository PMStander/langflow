# Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for development in the Partners In Biz project.

## Architecture

### Module Development
- Extend the core layer in module configuration
- Use standardized integration patterns for cross-module functionality
- Maintain module independence by avoiding direct imports from other modules
- Follow the established directory structure for consistency

### Core Layer Development
- Keep the core layer focused on truly shared functionality
- Provide clear interfaces for module integration
- Document all core components, services, and utilities
- Ensure backward compatibility when making changes
- Consolidate similar functionality into a single location to avoid duplication

## Code Quality

### TypeScript
- Use proper type definitions for all code
- Avoid using `any` type except when absolutely necessary
- Create and use interfaces for complex data structures
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

### Component Design
- Follow the component design guidelines
- Use props for input, events for output
- Document props, events, and slots
- Create reusable components for common patterns

### State Management
- Use Pinia for global state management
- Use composables for reusable logic
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Avoid prop drilling by using provide/inject when appropriate

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for all components and utilities
- Use test-driven development when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error handling

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Test module integration with the core layer
- Verify event handling and state updates

### End-to-End Testing
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test across module boundaries
- Verify that the system works as a whole

## Performance

### Optimization
- Use lazy loading for routes and components
- Optimize images and assets
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Monitoring
- Use performance monitoring tools
- Track key performance metrics
- Identify and address bottlenecks

## Security

### Authentication


### Data Protection
